The NFT wallet is a simple tool to keep track of NFTs. The Home page opens to a load of the top 25 NFTs on market. The Best Value page takes you to my reccomendation of the NFTs that are most worth your money. There is also a wallet where you can see the NFTs that you have added via the NFT Form. The NFTs also have a "View details" button that displays modals containing information about the NFT, including the name, price and a brief description of the collection.
